The goal of the project is to have a minimal USB controller for the Eventide H9 FX unit.

I want to jump to specific presets.
When I want an echo, I might want to jump from 1/1th to 1/8th note echo. Without the steps like 1/2th tripplet in between of the origianl app.

## Documenation
- H9 sysex messages: documentation/Eventide h9 141309_MIDISysexMessages.pdf
- H9 Algorithm Guide: documentation/H9AlgorithmGuide+V12.pdf

## Todo
- We need to be able to send out midi messages.
- We need to find out in what order each button on each effect is. That information we might be able to find in documentaion/H9AlgorithmGuide+V12.pdf

## Notes

Traktor delay rates:
 - 4/4, 3/8, 1/4, 3/16, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32
